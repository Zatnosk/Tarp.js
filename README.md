Tarp.js
======
Tarp.js is a fully clientside JavaScript library for the Tent protocol implementing v0.3. It is currently in alpha stage. For help with this library contact ^zatnosk.cupcake.is via Tent status posts.

A small example of the library's usage can be found in `example.html`.

Because it is a clientside library, it is dependent on some help to discover entities. For this purpose I've written a simple discovery service in PHP: [tarp-discover](https://github.com/Zatnosk/tarp-discover).
